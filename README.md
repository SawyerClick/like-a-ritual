# Is Punk Dead?
 Streaming killed punk music and I'm mad about it. 
 So here's a project of me ranting about exactly that!
 
 The project is housed over at https://sawyerclick.github.io/punk

 ### Why did you choose these songs?
 I grabbed every song off Spotify's flagship punk playlists, <i>not</i> user-created ones. 
 I'm looking at how commercialized punk music is being digested in the streaming age. 
 (Hot tip: it's not great)
 
 ### Where is the data coming from?
 I grabbed them all using Spotify's API. I used it to grab each playlist, loop through the songs and then grab each songs characteristics and features, as well as some general information about the artists.
 
 ### What analysis did you do?
Spotify's API comes with some handy features and characteristics, so I mostly just did a decade-by-decade breakdown, as well as looking at the biggest players in the playlists.
