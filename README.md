# Is Punk Dead?
 Streaming killed punk music and I'm mad about it. 
 So here's a project of me ranting about exactly that!

 ### Why did you choose these songs?
 I grabbed every song off Spotify's flagship punk playlists, <i>not</i> user-created ones. 
 I'm looking at how commercialized punk music is being digested in the streaming age. 
 (Hot tip: it's not great)
 
 ### Where is the data coming from?
 I grabbed them all using Spotify's API. I used it to grab each playlist, loop through the songs and then grab each songs characteristics and features, as well as some general information about the artists.
