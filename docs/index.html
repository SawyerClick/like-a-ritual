Tom isn't in Blink-182 anymore. Green Day is still a band? A Day To Remember made an edm song with Marshmello.</p> <p class="body-text">When you throw 21st-century curveballs like Spotify, which don't pay homage to forefathers in terms of prominence, its damn near impossible to narrow down what exactly punk looks like in 2019. But, we can try?</p> <p class="body-text">The genre is still high-energy and fast paced, proven by the Spotify data shown below. But only nineteen of the tracks in the 24 playlists have a popularity above 70%, and they're all from scene staples: four from Green Day, two from Fall Out Boy, two from blink-182, two from My Chemical Romance.</p> <p class="body-text">Though these artists were crucial to the 2000's era of punk music, they aren't the best representation of modern punk. All of the most popular songs were released over a decade ago. I mean, Fountain of Wayne's <em>Stacy's Mom</em> is the fourth most popular song in the playlists.</p> <p class="body-text">Each song is mapped out below as a single dot for each of the color categories, which represent an attribute of the song. Because it's a true reflection of the playlists, some songs appear twice, like Green Day's <i>Basket Case</i>, which is now the first and second most popular song.</p> </div> </section>

Across each decade represented in the playlists, which date back to the predeccesors of the 1960's, I grabbed the median artist followers and mean song energy to show how much the genre has changed.</p> </div> <div class="scrollytelling container-med"> <div class="chart" id="DecadesInPlaylists"></div> <div class="steps"> <div class="step" id="decade-count-step"> <h4 class="chart-head">New Artists, Few Followers</h4> <p class="body-text">Punk artists who released music in 2019 have, using the median, fewer than four times the number followers than artists who released songs in the 2010's, the second-least popular decade. </p> <p class="body-text"> So why is the decade represented so heavily? </p> <div id="followers-legend"></div> </div> <div class="step"> <p class="body-text"> Ideally, cramming new and unpopular artists into these playlists would give them an amplification and help boost their following. </p> <p class="body-text">But it seems that it actually does more to erase the genre's history. The 90's were more than blink-182 and Green Day.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="decade-energy-step"> <h4 class="chart-head">High Energy, Low Popularity</h4> <p class="body-text">The peak in the the average song popularity in the 80's was a result of not only Spotify cherry-picking fan-favorite songs but also the mainstream palatability of the tracks.</p> <div id="energy-legend"></div> </div> <div class="step"> <p class="body-text">The songs are less hyper than the influx of 90's angst that flooded in the decade after but are more potently pissed than the chill vibes of the 70's.</p> </div> <div class="step"> <p class="body-text">But it all came crashing down, except for a few break-out stars: Green Day, blink-182, My Chemical Romance. The genre dove back underground and didn't pick up its steam again.</p> </div> <div class="step"> <p class="body-text">Now, with the inundation of new artists in the playlists, the median artist is less popular than any other decade, but they're more energetic.</p> </div> </div> </div> </section> <script src="decades_in_playlists.0c714a4a.js"></script> <script src="scrollytelling.b6fcc127.js"></script> <script src="followers-legend.9b47462c.js"></script> <script src="energy-legend.9558e10f.js"></script> <section id="#footer"> <div class="container"> <h3 class="glitch-subhead" data-text="How Did I Make This?">How Did I Make This?</h3> <p class="body-text">I used <code>Command Line</code> to grab my Spotify <code>API</code> key.
