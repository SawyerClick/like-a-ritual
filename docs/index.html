Tom isn't in Blink-182 anymore. Green Day is still a band? A Day To Remember made an edm song with Marshmello.</p> <p class="body-text">When you throw 21st-century curveballs like Spotify, which don't pay homage to forefathers in terms of prominence, its damn near impossible to narrow down what exactly punk looks like in 2019. But, we can try?</p> <p class="body-text">The genre is still high-energy and fast paced, proven by the Spotify data shown below. But only nineteen of the tracks in the 24 playlists have a popularity above 70%, and they're all from scene staples: four from Green Day, two from Fall Out Boy, two from blink-182, two from My Chemical Romance.</p> <p class="body-text">Though these artists were crucial to the 2000's era of punk music, they aren't the best representation of modern punk. All of the most popular songs were released over a decade ago. I mean, Fountain of Wayne's <em>Stacy's Mom</em> is the fourth most popular song in the playlists.</p> </div> </section>

Across each decade represented in the playlists, which date back to the predeccesors of the 1960's, I grabbed the mean popularity and energy to show how much the genre has changed.</p> <div class="scrollytelling"> <div class="chart" id="DecadesInPlaylists"></div> <div class="container-med steps"> <div class="step" id="decade-count-step"> <h4 class="chart-head">New Artists, Few Followers</h4> <p class="body-text">The peak in the 80's stems from only a few dozen songs from the decade being sprinkled into the playlists. </p> <div id="followers-legend"></div> </div> <div class="step"> <p class="body-text">More songs from each decade appear in the playlists as they get closer to present day, starting with nearly none from the 60's and growing each decade to nearly 700 from 2019 alone.</p> <p class="body-text">Spotify is spending less time giving a platform to the genre's greats, gatekeeping a generation of listeners from discovering the genre's past.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="decade-energy-step"> <h4 class="chart-head">High Energy, Low Popularity</h4> <p class="body-text">With the average song popularity well above the rest of the decades, the energy was pretty medium compared to the other decades.The genre's skyrocketing population and energy led to what Spotify declares a stalwart </p> <div id="energy-legend"></div> </div> <div class="step"> <p class="body-text">The genre's skyrocketing population and energy led to what Spotify declares a stalwart </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <script src="decades_in_playlists.65a5a3d4.js"></script> <script src="scrollytelling.4c8d8e13.js"></script> <script src="followers-legend.66704da2.js"></script> <script src="energy-legend.5e9c781f.js"></script> <section id="2"> <div class="container"> <h3 class="glitch-subhead" data-text="Punk Soured Into Pop Punk">Punk Soured Into Pop Punk</h3> <p class="body-text">Spotify does some work to give nods to genre greats like Green Day and Fall Out Boy, but these playlists are primarily designed as vehicles to push new music onto fans.</p> <p class="body-text">That said, the genre's that Spotify is pushing is greatly different than the genres predeccessors. Even though the popular bands are still among the oldest, they're being cycled out and replaced with younger bands struggling with popularity.</p> <p class="body-text">These new bands are primarily very young, born in the late 2000's, and bring with them a subset of pop-punk characterized by post-emo lyrics centered around the lead singer's current emotional state.</p> </div> <div class="flex-container"> <div id="chart2"></div> <div class="infobox" style="visibility:hidden;"> <h4 class="underline">Genres</h4> <p class="genre">genres</p> </div> </div> </section> <div class="container-med"> <section id="3"> <div class="container"> <div class="control"> <button id="popularity-button" class="graph">popularity</button> <button id="energy-button" class="graph">energy</button> <button id="danceability-button" class="graph">danceability</button> <button id="valence-button" class="graph">valence</button> </div> <div id="chart3"></div> <div class="tooltip"></div> </div> </section> </div> <section id="#footer"> <div class="container"> <h3 class="glitch-subhead" data-text="How Did I Make This?">How Did I Make This?</h3> <p class="body-text">I used <code>Node.js</code> to grab my <code>API</code> key.
