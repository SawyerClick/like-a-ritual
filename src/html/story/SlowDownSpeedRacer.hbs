		<p class='body-text'>As decades have passed, the genre has increasingly lost its appeal, mostly because of Hip Hop and bubblegum pop's dominance in the 90's and 00's. Across each decade represented in the playlists, which date back to the predeccesors of the 1960's, I grabbed the median artist followers and mean song energy to show how much the genre has changed.</p>

				<h4 class='chart-head'>New Artists, Few Followers</h4>
				<p class='body-text'>Punk artists who released music in 2019 have, using the median, fewer than four times the number  followers than artists who released songs in the 2010's, the second-least popular decade. </p>
				<p class='body-text'>
					So why is the decade represented so heavily?
				</p>
				<div id="followers-legend"></div>

			<div class='step'>
				<p class='body-text'>
					Ideally, cramming new and unpopular artists into these playlists would give them an amplification and help boost their following. 
				</p>
				<p class='body-text'>But it seems that it actually does more to erase the genre's history. The 90's were more than blink-182 and Green Day.</p>
			</div>

			<div class='step' id='decade-energy-step'>
				<h4 class='chart-head'>High Energy, Low Popularity</h4>
				<p class='body-text'>The peak in the the average song popularity in the 80's was a result of not only Spotify cherry-picking fan-favorite songs but also the mainstream palatability of the tracks.</p>
				
				<div id="energy-legend"></div>
			</div>

			<div class='step'>
				<p class='body-text'>The songs are less hyper than the influx of 90's angst that flooded in the decade after but are more potently pissed than the chill vibes of the 70's.</p>
			</div> 

			<div class='step'>
				<p class='body-text'>But it all came crashing down, except for a few break-out stars: Green Day, blink-182, My Chemical Romance. The genre dove back underground and didn't pick up its steam again.</p>
			</div>    

			<div class='step'>
				<p class='body-text'>Now, with the inundation of new artists in the playlists, the median artist is less popular than any other decade, but they're more energetic.</p>
